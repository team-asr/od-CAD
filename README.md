Repository for Open Drone CAD files

These are as elaborate as needed for your to build your own drone. They also provide various resources to develop various fixures necessary to fit certain sensors on your drone.

To develop your own drone using these files, acquire the profile side you require and cut it using your prefered material. We are fond of plywood. Acquire side profiles and top and bottom profiles and you now have your complete fuselage.
You now require electronics and wiring them together.
