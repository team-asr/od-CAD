Use EPP or XPS foam sheeting and cut front, side and top profiles on the block.
Templates are made by printing each profile and tracing out templates from plywood profiles.
For instance. Print image heavy-right.png and attach it to a plywood sheet. Cut out the image only showing the 
body profile (ignore propellers and motors for now). Make two plywood templates this way.
Run a hotwire through your sheet of foam and you will have the fuselage bearing the side profile.
To create the top profile, repeat the process using the top image.

Notes on making the fuselage capable of load bearing:
Re-enforce the body after cutting it using the hotwire by:
1. Slice the fuselage in half.
2. Cut out payload area, and electronics areas as required.
3. Attach plywood bulkheads to make the fuselage stiff as appropriate.
4. Use epoxy resign to strengthen the areas as required.
5. Re-assemble the fuselage and cover it in epoxy resign and fiberglass cloth
Notes on selection of propulsion
1. Use propellers rated above the weight of the entire vehicle, calculated as the all-up weight
(payload + empty aircraft weight)
2. Use motors and motor mounts whos cumulative thrust exceeds all-up weight.
3. Use heavy-gauge wire for power deliver from the lipo battery. SAFETY IS PARAMOUNT.
